# rule30
terminal simulation of rule30 created by steven wolfram
mentioned here in wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30
I was interested in writing code to produce pattern like it.
the code by default produces the picture in the wiki but anyone can play with the code 
and produce any pattern with a rule between 0 and 255 inclusive.

I couldn't find a way to make the shape with squares on linux so feel free to contribute
and if you have any notes,issues,suggestions send me a PR
